# DEPLOYMENT TROUBLESHOOTING - No Autoscale Option

## Issue: Autoscale Deployment Not Available

This could be due to several factors:

### Possible Reasons:
1. **Account Plan Limitations**: Free accounts may have restricted deployment options
2. **Workspace Type**: Some Agent-created apps have deployment restrictions
3. **Payment Method**: Deployments may require billing setup
4. **Geographic Restrictions**: Some deployment types not available in all regions

### Alternative Solutions:

#### Option 1: Reserved VM Deployment
- Look for "Reserved VM" option instead of Autoscale
- Provides dedicated compute resources
- Works with full-stack Agent apps

#### Option 2: Check Available Options
What deployment options DO you see when clicking Deploy?
- Static (we know this won't work for Agent apps)
- Reserved VM
- Any other options listed?

#### Option 3: Account Verification
- Verify your Replit plan (Free/Core/Teams)
- Check if payment method is required
- Look for any error messages or warnings

### Configuration for Any Deployment Type:
- **Start Command:** `npm start`
- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Port:** 5000 (already configured)
- **Environment:** Production

### Next Steps:
1. Tell me what deployment options you DO see
2. Check your account plan/billing status
3. Look for any error messages
4. We'll configure whatever deployment type is available

The app is technically ready - we just need to work with whatever deployment option Replit provides for your specific account/workspace.
