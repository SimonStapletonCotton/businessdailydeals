# Comprehensive Test Plan - Preventing Functionality Degradation

## Critical Functionality Testing

### 1. Image Display System
**Status**: RECENTLY FIXED - Monitor closely for regression
- Hot Deals images loading correctly
- Regular Deals images loading correctly
- Fallback system working for missing images
- DealImage component error handling

**Test Commands**:
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:5000/public-objects/product-images/6y9M7PQvU4JNi6f8A39ra.jpg
```

### 2. Deal Management System
- Deal creation workflow
- Deal listing (Hot/Regular)
- Deal editing and updates
- Deal expiry extension
- Deal status management

### 3. Authentication System
- Login/logout functionality
- Session persistence
- Role-based access (buyer/supplier)
- Protected route access

### 4. Payment Integration
- PayFast integration
- Credit purchase workflow
- Coupon purchase workflow
- Email confirmation system

### 5. Database Operations
- User registration
- Deal CRUD operations
- Coupon generation
- Business statistics calculation

### 6. Email System
- Registration confirmations
- Payment confirmations
- Find Me a Deal notifications
- Admin notifications

## Regression Prevention Strategies

### 1. Component Isolation
- Each major component has fallback mechanisms
- Error boundaries prevent cascade failures
- Graceful degradation for non-critical features

### 2. Data Integrity
- Database constraints prevent corruption
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Transaction rollback on failures

### 3. Monitoring & Alerts
- Health check endpoints (`/api/health/detailed`)
- Automated stability checks (`stability-check.sh`)
- Performance monitoring
- Error logging and tracking

### 4. Recovery Procedures
- Automatic component restart mechanisms
- Database connection pool management
- Session recovery for interrupted workflows
- Graceful handling of external service failures

## Stability Maintenance Schedule

### Daily Checks
- Run stability-check.sh
- Monitor error logs
- Verify critical user paths

### Weekly Reviews
- Performance metrics analysis
- Database maintenance
- Security updates
- Dependency updates

### Monthly Assessments
- Full system health audit
- Component interaction testing
- Scalability testing
- Backup and recovery testing

## Critical Path Monitoring

### User Registration Flow
1. Registration form submission
2. Database user creation
3. Session establishment
4. Dashboard access

### Deal Posting Flow
1. Authenticated supplier access
2. Deal form completion
3. Image upload (if applicable)
4. Database storage
5. Deal visibility in listings

### Deal Discovery Flow
1. Deal listing page access
2. Image loading and display
3. Deal filtering and search
4. Coupon generation for inquiries

### Payment Processing Flow
1. Credit/coupon purchase initiation
2. PayFast redirection
3. Payment processing
4. Webhook handling
5. Email confirmations
6. Database updates

## Automated Testing Integration

The system includes:
- Health monitoring endpoints
- Automated stability checks
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Performance monitoring
- Database integrity checks

Run `./stability-check.sh` regularly to ensure system health and prevent functionality degradation.
