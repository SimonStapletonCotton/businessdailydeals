# Connect www.businessdailydeals.co.za to Replit for Automatic Updates

## Goal
Connect your custom domain directly to Replit deployment so every code change updates automatically without manual file uploads.

## Current Problem
- Your domain points to Cybersmart hosting (static files)
- Changes require manual upload to Cybersmart servers
- Replit deployments don't update your live domain

## Solution: Point Domain to Replit

### Step 1: Add Custom Domain in Replit
1. Go to your Replit project
2. Click "Deploy" → "Deployments" 
3. In Overview tab, find "Custom Domains" section
4. Click "Add Domain"
5. Enter: `www.businessdailydeals.co.za`
6. Replit will provide DNS records to add

### Step 2: Update DNS Records
You'll need to update DNS at your domain registrar with Replit's provided records:

**A Record:**
- Name: `www` 
- Value: [Replit IP address - provided after adding domain]
- TTL: 3600

**TXT Record (for verification):**
- Name: `_replit-challenge.www`
- Value: [Verification token - provided by Replit]
- TTL: 3600

### Step 3: Wait for Propagation
- DNS changes take 1-48 hours to propagate
- Check status in Replit Deployments tab

### Result After Setup
✅ www.businessdailydeals.co.za points directly to Replit
✅ Every "Redeploy" in Replit updates your live site instantly
✅ No more manual file uploads to Cybersmart
✅ Automatic casino homepage updates
✅ All future changes deploy automatically
