# Replit Domain Routing Solution

## The Issue
- Current URL: https://b4c4fa9a-c209-4d1e-9ad6-d30acf9c86d2.worf.prod.repl.run/
- Not practical for business marketing
- Replit shows "Business Daily Deals" as registered domain
- Should be able to route through this domain

## Expected Professional URLs
If "Business Daily Deals" is registered in Replit, you should get:
- `businessdailydeals.replit.app`
- `business-daily-deals.replit.app`
- `bdd.replit.app`
- Or similar clean format

## How Replit Domain Routing Should Work
1. **Project Recognition**: Replit knows your project as "Business Daily Deals"
2. **Automatic Routing**: Should provide clean .replit.app subdomain

2. **Activate Primary Routing**: Make this domain the main address
3. **Update Business Materials**: Use professional URL immediately
4. **Launch Marketing**: Start connecting suppliers and buyers

## Business Impact
Instead of: `b4c4fa9a-c209-4d1e-9ad6-d30acf9c86d2.worf.prod.repl.run`
