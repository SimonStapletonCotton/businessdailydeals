# IMAGE DISPLAY: BULLETPROOF SOLUTION PLAN

## Problem Analysis
Images display initially but disappear after React hot reloads, indicating the native DOM approach needs protection against framework interference.

## Enhanced Solution Features

### 1. Hot Reload Resistance
- Force re-render detection with state change trigger
- Multiple style reapplication timers (10ms, 100ms)
- Unique timestamp cache-busting for image sources

### 2. Aggressive Style Protection
- Detailed CSS with !important declarations
- Style reapplication after DOM insertion
- Protection against React virtual DOM overwrites

### 3. Container Persistence
- Reference validation before DOM operations
- Cleanup prevention of valid image elements
- Container style forcing alongside image styles

### 4. Monitoring & Debugging
- Enhanced logging with dimension reporting
- Hot-reload protection confirmation logs
- Failure state tracking with specific error messages

## Expected Outcome
Images remain visible through:
- React hot module replacement
- Component re-renders
- Development environment changes
- Production environment stability
