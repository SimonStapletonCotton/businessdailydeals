## Issue
- "Redeploy" button visible but not responding when clicked
- Deployment URLs return 404 (no deployment exists yet)

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Option 1: Browser Solutions
1. **Hard refresh** your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Try incognito/private mode** to rule out browser cache issues
3. **Clear browser cache** for replit.com

### Option 2: Account Configuration
1. **Check payment method**: Deployment failures often relate to billing
2. **Verify account status**: Ensure your Replit account is in good standing
3. **Contact Replit support** if continuous payment failures are suspected

### Option 3: Direct URL Access
Try accessing deployment management directly:
- `https://replit.com/@simons27/DealStream/deployments`

### Option 4: Alternative Deployment
If Redeploy continues to fail:
1. **Export the project**: Download as ZIP
2. **Create new Repl**: Import into fresh repl
3. **Deploy from new repl**: Sometimes fixes deployment system issues

## What Should Happen When Deployment Works
Once deployment succeeds, you'll get:
- **Production URL**: `https://dealstream--simons27.replit.app` (or similar)
- **Secure HTTPS**: Proper SSL certificates
- **24/7 Hosting**: Reliable public access
- **Full Marketplace**: All features working in production

## Current Development Status
Your marketplace is fully functional in development mode with:
- 1 active supplier, 13 total deals
- Business statistics displaying correctly
- Professional interface with casino theme
- Free promotional period clearly displayed

The only missing piece is triggering Replit's deployment system to make it publicly accessible.
