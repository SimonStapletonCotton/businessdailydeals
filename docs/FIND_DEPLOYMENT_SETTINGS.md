# Finding Deployment Settings in Replit

## You're Looking in the Right Place!
- You're in the Deployments tab ✅
- You see your deal-stream HTTPS URL ✅
- But clicking the URL opens your website (not settings)

## To Find Settings:

### Option 1: Look for Buttons/Icons
Next to your deployment URL, look for:
- **"Configure"** button
- **"Settings"** button  
- **Gear icon** ⚙️
- **Three dots** ⋯ menu
- **"Manage"** link

### Option 2: Right-Click the Deployment
- Right-click on the deployment entry (not the URL)
- Look for context menu with settings

### Option 3: Deployment Card Layout
Your deployment might be displayed as a card with:
- Title at top
- URL in middle
- **Settings/Configure at bottom**

### Option 4: Tabs Within Deployments
After selecting your deployment, look for tabs:
- Overview
- **Settings** ← This is what you need
- Domains
- Logs

## What You're Looking For:
Once in settings, you'll find:
- **"Link a domain"** button
- **"Custom Domain"** section
- **"Add Domain"** option

The key is NOT clicking the URL itself, but finding the management controls for that deployment.
