# cPanel Deployment Fix - ES Module Error Solution

## The Problem
Your cPanel app is still trying to load `app.js` instead of the CommonJS version `businessdailydeals-app.cjs`.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Update cPanel App Configuration (Recommended)
1. **In cPanel** → **Node.js App**
2. **Find your app settings**
3. **Change "Startup File" from**: `app.js` 
4. **Change "Startup File" to**: `businessdailydeals-app.cjs`
5. **Click "Restart"**

### Option 2: Replace Existing app.js File
Upload the `.cjs` content as `app.js`:

```bash
# Rename the working file to app.js
cp businessdailydeals-app.cjs app.js
```

### Option 3: Modify package.json (Alternative)
Change in your uploaded `package.json`:
```json
{
  "type": "commonjs"
}
```
Instead of:
```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

## Files to Upload for Deployment
- `businessdailydeals-app.cjs` (the working server file)
- `package.json` (with dependencies)
- `public/` folder (your React frontend build)

## After Fix
Your app will:
- ✅ Load without ES module errors
- ✅ Connect to Cybersmart MySQL database  
- ✅ Serve your casino homepage with deals
- ✅ Handle all API endpoints properly

## Most Likely Solution
The issue is in your cPanel Node.js app configuration - it's still pointing to `app.js` instead of `businessdailydeals-app.cjs`. Update the startup file setting in cPanel.
