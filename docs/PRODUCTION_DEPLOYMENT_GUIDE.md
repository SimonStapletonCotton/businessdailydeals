## Step 1: Replit Deployment (YOU DO THIS)

### 1.1 Deploy on Replit
1. **Click the "Deploy" button** in your Replit workspace
2. **Choose "Autoscale Deployment"** for production traffic handling
3. **Set deployment name**: `business-daily-deals-prod`
4. **Environment**: Production
5. **Scaling**: Auto (handles traffic spikes automatically)

### 1.2 Domain Configuration
1. **Note the deployment URL** Replit provides (e.g., `your-app.replit.app`)
2. **Configure DNS** for www.businessdailydeals.co.za:
   - Point CNAME to your Replit deployment URL
   - Or use A record if required by your DNS provider
3. **SSL Certificate**: Replit provides this automatically

## Step 2: Database Migration to Production MySQL

**Database Credentials** (from `CYBERSMART_DATABASE_CREDENTIALS.md`):

**In your Replit deployment environment variables:**
