# Alternative Plan for Cybersmart

**If you can't download the tar.gz file, tell Cybersmart:**

## Option A: Remote Assistance
*"Can you provide remote desktop assistance to help me upload my Node.js application files through cPanel? I have the files ready but need help with the upload process."*

## Option B: They Upload Key Files
*"I need help uploading these specific files to my Node.js app directory:*
- *package.json (contains app dependencies)*
- *server/ folder (contains the application)*
- *client/ folder (contains the website)*

*Can you help me create these through cPanel File Manager?"*

## Option C: Simple Deployment
*"Can you help me deploy a simple Node.js 'Hello World' application first to test the setup, then we'll add the marketplace files?"*

**Bottom Line:** Most hosting companies can help you upload files - it's a standard service request.
