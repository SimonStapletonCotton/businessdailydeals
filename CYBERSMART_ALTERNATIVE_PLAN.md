# Alternative Solutions for Business Daily Deals

Since Cybersmart is limiting support, here are your options:

## Option 1: Different Hosting Provider
- **Recommendation**: Move to a hosting provider that supports Node.js properly
- **Examples**: Vercel, Netlify, DigitalOcean, AWS, or another South African host
- **Benefit**: Full control over your application deployment

## Option 2: Deploy on Replit Production
- **Current Status**: Your app is working perfectly on Replit
- **Action**: Use Replit's deployment feature to get a production URL
- **Benefit**: No hosting complications, immediate deployment

## Option 3: Simple cPanel Upload
- **If you have cPanel access**: Upload the HTML file yourself
- **File**: I've created the complete index.html file
- **Location**: Upload to public_html directory
- **Benefit**: Bypass Cybersmart's limitations

## Option 4: Find Technical Assistance
- **Local developer**: Hire someone in South Africa to handle the hosting setup
- **Web designer**: Many can handle simple file uploads
- **IT consultant**: For ongoing technical support

## Recommended Next Steps:
1. Try Replit deployment first (easiest)
2. If you want to stay with Cybersmart, see if they'll do the simple file upload
3. Consider moving to a more developer-friendly hosting provider

Your marketplace is ready - it just needs to be deployed properly.
