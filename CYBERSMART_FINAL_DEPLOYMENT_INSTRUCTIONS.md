# CYBERSMART: Final Deployment Instructions

## Current Issue:
Your website shows "Coming Soon" instead of the complete marketplace, even though npm modules are installed.

## SOLUTION: Replace app.js with Production Version

**Step 1: Replace app.js Content**
Copy the complete content from: `CYBERSMART_PRODUCTION_APP.js` and replace everything in your current `/home/simonsta/public_html/businessdailydeals-fixed/app.js` file.

**Step 2: Restart Node.js App**
In cPanel, restart your Node.js application.

**Step 3: Test Your Website**
Visit www.businessdailydeals.co.za - you should now see:
- ✅ Professional Business Daily Deals homepage
- ✅ Working API endpoints (/api/health, /api/deals, /api/business/stats)
- ✅ Complete marketplace functionality
- ✅ No more "Coming Soon" page

## What the Production App Includes:
- ✅ MySQL database integration with your credentials
- ✅ Full API endpoints for deals, stats, and business data
- ✅ Professional landing page with your branding
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Production security features
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Static file serving for React components

## After Replacement:
Your website will show a fully functional Business Daily Deals marketplace instead of the basic "Coming Soon" page.

## Technical Details:
- Uses your MySQL database credentials automatically
- Serves your React app if client/dist exists
- Falls back to professional landing page if needed
- Includes all necessary API endpoints
- Proper production configuration

**This should resolve the "Coming Soon" issue and activate your complete marketplace!**
