# Request to Cybersmart: MySQL Database Credentials Needed

## TO: Cybersmart Support
## FROM: Simon (www.businessdailydeals.co.za)
## SUBJECT: MySQL Database Credentials Required for Node.js App

---

**REQUEST**: Please provide the MySQL database credentials for my Business Daily Deals application.

**NEEDED INFORMATION**:
1. **MySQL Database Username**
2. **MySQL Database Password**
3. **MySQL Database Name** 
4. **MySQL Host** (confirm it's `localhost`)

**PURPOSE**: These credentials are required as environment variables for my Node.js application to connect to the MySQL database you created.

**CURRENT STATUS**: 
- Node.js app is configured and running
- `app.js` startup file is created
- Missing only the MySQL database connection details

**NEXT STEPS**: Once I have these credentials, I will:
1. Add them as environment variables in the Node.js app configuration
2. Restart the application
3. www.businessdailydeals.co.za will be fully operational

**URGENCY**: This is the final step to make the website live.

Thank you for your assistance.

**Technical Note**: The application is designed to automatically detect MySQL credentials and connect to your database server instead of using the development database.
