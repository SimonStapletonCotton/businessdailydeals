Hi Cybersmart Team,

Thank you for confirming MySQL support with the following specifications:
- âœ… MySQL version 5.7.44
- âœ… phpMyAdmin management interface
- âœ… 51,200 MB storage allocation  
- âœ… 151 concurrent connections
- âœ… Weekly automated backups

I'm ready to proceed with the database setup for my B2B marketplace application. Please provide the following MySQL database credentials:

## Required Database Information

**Database Details:**
- Database name: `businessdailydeals_db` (or your preferred format)
- MySQL username: [to be provided]
- MySQL password: [to be provided]
- Host: localhost (as confirmed)
- Port: 3306 (as confirmed)

**Additional Information Needed:**
1. **Database Creation Process**: Do you create the database, or do I create it via cPanel?
2. **phpMyAdmin Access**: URL and login credentials for database management
3. **Connection String Format**: Full MySQL connection string format for Node.js
4. **Backup Schedule**: Confirmation of weekly automated backup timing
5. **Import/Export**: File size limits for database imports (for initial data)

## Application Technical Details

My application is a Node.js B2B marketplace that will:
- Store user accounts, product deals, and transaction records
- Use approximately 15-20 database tables
- Handle typical business-to-business traffic volumes
- Require standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

## Next Steps

Once I receive the database credentials, I will:
1. Test the database connection
2. Initialize the database schema (tables and relationships)
3. Deploy the application to your servers
4. Configure the production environment

**Estimated deployment time:** 3-4 hours after receiving credentials

Please provide these details so I can finalize the application configuration and complete the deployment to businessdailydeals.co.za.

Best regards,  
Simon
