# Simplified Cybersmart Request - No File Upload Needed

**Subject:** Node.js App Deployment - Need Remote Assistance

---

Hi Cybersmart Team,

I need help deploying my Business Daily Deals marketplace. Instead of file uploads, can you provide **remote desktop assistance** to help me?

**What I Need:**
1. **Remote screen sharing session** to help configure my Node.js app
2. **Database creation**: MySQL database named `businessdailydeals_prod`
3. **Help uploading application files** through cPanel interface

**Current Status:**
- Node.js app configured in cPanel
- Environment variables set
- Application ready for deployment

**Request:**
Can someone from your technical team schedule a 30-minute remote assistance session to help me deploy the application? This would be much faster than trying to upload files manually.

**Contact:** Please call or email to arrange the remote session.

This is a production business launch, so urgent assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
Simons
