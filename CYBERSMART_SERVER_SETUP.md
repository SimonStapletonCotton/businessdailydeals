Hi Cybersmart Team,

Following your response about Node.js availability, I need to confirm database support for my B2B marketplace application:

**Required Database Features:**
- MySQL database server
- Database creation and management access
- Support for database connections from Node.js
- Backup and restore capabilities
- Database size limit information

**Additional Questions:**
1. What MySQL versions are available?
2. How do I access database management (phpMyAdmin/cPanel)?
3. What are the database size and connection limits?
4. Can you provide database connection details (host, port, credentials)?
5. Do you support automated database backups?

**Application Details:**
- Node.js B2B marketplace with user authentication
- Image upload and storage capabilities
- PayFast payment integration
- Email notification system

Please confirm MySQL availability so I can proceed with the application setup.

Best regards,
Simon
