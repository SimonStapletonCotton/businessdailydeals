# Cybersmart Passenger Diagnosis - Coming Soon Issue

## ISSUE: Node.js App Not Loading Complete Marketplace

**Current Status**: Application starts but serves placeholder "coming soon" instead of full Business Daily Deals marketplace

## DIAGNOSIS STEPS

### 1. Check Passenger Log File
In cPanel Node.js Apps, check the log file:
`/home/simonsta/logs/businessdailydeals.log`

**Look for these error patterns:**
- Module not found errors
- Database connection failures  
- Missing dependencies
- Route registration failures

### 2. Verify File Structure
Application root should contain:
```
businessdailydeals-fixed/
├── server/
│   ├── index.js (complete server file)
│   ├── routes.js (all API endpoints)
│   ├── storage.js (database operations)
│   └── db.js (MySQL connection)
├── client/
│   └── dist/ (React build files)
├── shared/
│   └── schema.js (database schemas)
└── package.json (all dependencies)
```

### 3. Common Passenger Issues

**Issue A: Missing Dependencies**
- Solution: Run NPM install in correct directory
- Check: node_modules folder exists with all packages

**Issue B: Wrong Entry Point**
- Current: server/index.js
- Alternative: Try app.js in root directory
- Check: File actually imports routes and database

**Issue C: Database Connection Failure**
- MySQL credentials not accessible
- Database doesn't exist
- Connection timeout

## IMMEDIATE FIX APPROACH

### Option 1: Create Simplified app.js in Root
Create single-file application that combines server + routes + database in root directory

### Option 2: Rebuild Package Structure
Ensure all files are in correct relative paths for Passenger

### Option 3: Alternative Startup File
Try different entry points until one works

## CYBERSMART SUPPORT REQUEST
If logs show persistent errors, contact support with:
- Screenshot of Node.js app configuration

- Specific error: "Node.js app starts but serves placeholder instead of complete marketplace"

The goal is to serve your complete orange-themed B2B marketplace with 8 Hot Deals and all features, not a basic "coming soon" page.
