# URGENT: Cybersmart Support Request

**Subject: Node.js Application Configuration Issue - www.businessdailydeals.co.za**

Dear Cybersmart Support Team,

We have successfully created the Node.js application in cPanel with:
- ✅ Node.js 18.20.8 enabled
- ✅ package.json created
- ✅ server/index.js created
- ✅ Application shows "started" status

**ISSUE:** Website shows "We're sorry but something went wrong" error despite server status showing "started"

**URGENT REQUEST:** Please assist with:
1. **Check Node.js app configuration** - verify startup script points to correct file
2. **Review error logs** - check what's causing the startup failure
3. **Verify file permissions** - ensure proper read/execute permissions
4. **Database setup** - we need database "businessdailydeals_prod" created

**FILES LOCATION:**
- Application folder: public_html/businessdailydeals/
- Main file: server/index.js
- Package file: package.json

**NEXT STEP:** Once basic "Coming Soon" page loads, we'll upload the complete marketplace files.

Please provide remote assistance to resolve this Node.js startup issue.

Best regards,
Business Daily Deals Team
