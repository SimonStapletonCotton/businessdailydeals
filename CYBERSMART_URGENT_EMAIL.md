# Urgent Cybersmart Support Request

**Subject:** URGENT: Node.js Application Deployment Assistance Required

---

Hi Cybersmart Team,

I need immediate assistance with deploying my Business Daily Deals marketplace application.

**Current Status:**
- Node.js app configured in cPanel (Node.js 18.20.8)
- Environment variables set correctly
- Application files ready for upload

**Immediate Help Needed:**
1. **File Upload**: I have a deployment package (`businessdailydeals-upload.tar.gz`) that needs to be uploaded and extracted to `/home/simonsta/public_html/businessdailydeals/`

2. **NPM Install**: Run `npm install` in the application directory to install dependencies

3. **Database Creation**: Create MySQL database named `businessdailydeals_prod` and provide credentials

4. **Application Start**: Restart the Node.js application after setup

**Timeline:** This is urgent - the marketplace is ready for production launch today.

**Contact:** Please call me immediately if possible, or respond via email with next steps.

The application is fully developed and tested. I just need technical assistance with the server deployment process.

Thank you for immediate attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Simons
