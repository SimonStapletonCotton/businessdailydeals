Subject: Simple Request - Just Upload One File

Hi Cybersmart,

I understand you're a hosting service, not developers. This is very simple - just one file upload.

Can you please:
1. Create a file called index.html in public_html
2. Copy and paste the content I'm sending below into that file
3. Save it

That's all. No development needed - just a simple file upload.

The file content is attached separately.

If you cannot do this simple file upload, please let me know and I'll find an alternative solution.

Thank you,
Simon
