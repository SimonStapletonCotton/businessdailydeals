QUICK FIX: Missing Frontend Files

ERROR: "ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/home/simonsta/public_html/businessdailydeals/public/index.html'"

SOLUTION:
You need to upload the frontend files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to the `public/` folder.

FILES TO UPLOAD:
1. Download the `cpanel-public/` folder from the deployment package
2. Upload it to: `/home/simonsta/public_html/businessdailydeals/`
3. Rename the uploaded folder from `cpanel-public` to `public`

EXPECTED STRUCTURE:
/home/simonsta/public_html/businessdailydeals/
├── app.js (your server file)
├── package.json
├── .htaccess
└── public/
    ├── index.html
    ├── assets/
    └── other frontend files

VERIFICATION:
Once uploaded, restart your Node.js app and visit www.businessdailydeals.co.za
The marketplace homepage should load with February 2026 content.

The server is working correctly - it just needs the frontend files to serve to visitors.
