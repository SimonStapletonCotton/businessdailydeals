---

Hi Priya,

Thank you for the excellent setup! The Node.js environment, SSL, and email are perfect.

**Database Configuration:**
Please create the database with these settings:
- **Database Name:** `businessdailydeals_prod`
- **Character Set:** utf8mb4
- **Collation:** utf8mb4_unicode_ci

**Application Deployment:**
We're ready to proceed with the Node.js application setup in cPanel. The application will require:
- MySQL database access
- File upload permissions
- Standard Node.js runtime environment

**Next Steps:**
1. Create the database with the specified name
2. Provide database credentials (username, password)
3. We'll configure the Node.js application in cPanel
4. Upload and deploy the Business Daily Deals marketplace

The application is fully tested and ready for production deployment once the database is created.

Thank you for your efficient setup!

Best regards,
Simons
