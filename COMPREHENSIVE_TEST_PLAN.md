# Business Daily Deals - Comprehensive Testing & Stability Plan

## Critical Stability Issues Identified
- Deal type labeling reverting to hardcoded values
- Find Me a Deal dropdown functionality breaking
- Image display intermittently failing
- Components becoming unstable between sessions

## 1. AUTOMATED TESTING FRAMEWORK

### Backend API Tests
```bash
# Core functionality tests to run before any deployment
curl -f http://localhost:5000/api/health || exit 1
curl -f http://localhost:5000/api/deals | grep -q "dealType" || exit 1
curl -f http://localhost:5000/public-objects/product-images/test.jpg || echo "Image serving test needed"
```

### Database Integrity Checks
```sql
-- Verify deal types are properly stored
SELECT DISTINCT deal_type FROM deals;
-- Should return: hot, regular

-- Check image URLs are properly formatted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deals WHERE image_url LIKE '/public-objects/%';
-- Should match deals with images

-- Verify promotional period logic
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE promotional_period_ends = '2025-12-31';
```

## 2. COMPONENT STABILITY CHECKLIST

### Critical Components to Monitor
- [ ] deal-card-fixed.tsx (dealType logic)
- [ ] find-me-deal.tsx (dropdown functionality)
- [ ] home-comprehensive.tsx (image display)
- [ ] supplier-dashboard.tsx (extend functionality)

### Required Checks Before Any Code Changes
1. Backup current working state
2. Test deal type display (hot vs regular)
3. Test Find Me a Deal form submission
4. Verify image loading on all pages
5. Check promotional period logic

## 3. DEPLOYMENT SAFEGUARDS

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All LSP diagnostics resolved
- [ ] No hardcoded values in components
- [ ] Database schema matches code expectations
- [ ] Object storage connectivity verified
- [ ] Email notification system ready (SendGrid)

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Homepage loads with correct deal types
- [ ] Images display properly
- [ ] Forms submit successfully
- [ ] Navigation functions work
- [ ] Dynamic statistics update

## 4. BACKUP AND RECOVERY STRATEGY

### Critical Files to Monitor
- client/src/components/deal-card-fixed.tsx
- client/src/pages/find-me-deal.tsx
- client/src/pages/home-comprehensive.tsx
- server/routes.ts
- shared/schema.ts

### Recovery Procedures
1. Document exact working state before changes
2. Create checkpoint snapshots
3. Maintain rollback procedures
4. Test recovery process

## 5. MONITORING AND ALERTS

### Key Metrics to Track
- Deal type accuracy (no hardcoded "HOT DEAL")
- Image load success rate
- Form submission success rate
- API response times
- Database connection stability

### Error Patterns to Watch
- Components reverting to hardcoded states
- Form validation breaking
- Object storage connectivity issues
- Authentication/session problems

## 6. STABILITY MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL

### Daily Checks
1. Verify deal type labels are dynamic
2. Test form functionality
3. Check image loading
4. Confirm promotional period logic

### Weekly Maintenance
1. Review and update this test plan
2. Verify backup procedures
3. Test rollback capabilities
4. Update documentation

## 7. CYBERSMART PRODUCTION READINESS

### Final Deployment Criteria
- [ ] All automated tests passing
- [ ] No known stability issues
- [ ] Complete backup documentation
- [ ] Recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Performance optimization complete

### Production Monitoring Setup
- Health check endpoints active
- Error logging configured
- Performance metrics tracking
- User feedback collection system
