# Cybersmart Hosting Deployment Guide

## Phase 1: Immediate Shared Hosting Adaptation

Based on Cybersmart's hosting limitations, here's the deployment strategy:

### 1. Database Setup (MySQL 5.7.44)
**Steps for Cybersmart cPanel:**
1. Login to cPanel → "Manage My Databases"
2. Create new database: `businessdailydeals_main`
3. Create database user with full privileges
4. Get connection details for environment variables

**Required Environment Variables:**
```
MYSQL_DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:password@hostname:3306/businessdailydeals_main
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-key
```

### 2. File Upload & Configuration
**Files to upload via cPanel File Manager:**
- All project files (excluding node_modules)
- `.htaccess` (already configured for Apache)
- `package.json` and dependencies
- Environment configuration

**Post-Upload Steps:**
1. Run `npm install` via terminal/SSH
2. Run database migrations: `npm run db:migrate:mysql`
3. Test connection: `node -e "require('./server/db.mysql.js').testConnection()"`

### 3. Production Startup
**Since PM2 not available, use Node.js built-in clustering:**
- Modified `server/index.ts` to include cluster module
- Graceful restart handling
- Process monitoring via logs

### 4. Domain Configuration
- SSL already configured ✅
- Apache mod_rewrite for SPA routing ✅
- Static file serving optimized ✅

## Phase 2: VPS Migration (If Needed)

If shared hosting limitations become problematic:

**Cloud VPS Benefits:**
- Full PostgreSQL support
- PM2 process management
- Nginx reverse proxy
- Custom Node.js configuration
- Better performance and control

**Migration Trigger Points:**
- High traffic volumes
- Need for real-time features
- Advanced database requirements
- Custom deployment pipelines

## Cost Comparison:
- **Shared Hosting**: Lower cost, good for launch
- **Cloud VPS**: Higher cost, full control and scalability

## Recommendation:
Start with shared hosting adaptation for cost-effective launch, monitor performance, and migrate to VPS when business growth justifies the additional investment.
