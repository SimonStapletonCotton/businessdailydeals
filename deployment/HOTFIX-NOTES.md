# Hot Deals Loading Issue - FIXED

## Problem Identified:
- Server API working correctly ✅
- Dashboard showing deals ✅  
- Hot Deals page showing "Loading..." forever ❌

## Root Cause:
Frontend React code expects `DealWithSupplier` type:
```typescript
{
  supplier: {
    id: string;
    companyName: string;
    isVerified: boolean;
  }
}
```

But production API was returning:
```javascript
{
  supplier: "Office Solutions SA"  // String instead of object
}
```

## Solution Applied:
Updated `app.js` sample data structure to match React frontend expectations:
- Changed `supplier: "Company Name"` to `supplier: { id, companyName, isVerified }`
- Added required fields: `supplierId`, `category`, `isActive`, `createdAt`

## Files Updated:
- `deployment/app.js` - Fixed sample data structure
- All 8 hot deals now have proper supplier objects

## Test:
Upload updated `app.js` and Hot Deals should load immediately with 8 deals showing.
