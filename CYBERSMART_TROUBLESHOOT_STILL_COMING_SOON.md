# 404 Error Troubleshooting for Cybersmart

The 404 error means the file isn't being served properly. Here are the troubleshooting steps:

## Issue: File Location or Name Problem

**Check these in File Manager:**
1. **File name**: Must be exactly `index.html` (not Index.html or index.HTML)
2. **File location**: Must be in the ROOT of public_html (not in a subfolder)
3. **File extension**: Must end with .html (not .txt or no extension)

## Most Common Issues:

### 1. Wrong Directory
- File should be: `/public_html/index.html`
- NOT: `/public_html/businessdailydeals/index.html`
- NOT: `/public_html/www/index.html`

### 2. Wrong File Name
- Should be: `index.html`
- NOT: `Index.html` or `INDEX.html`
- NOT: `index.htm`

### 3. File Saved as Text
- Make sure it's saved as HTML file
- Check the file icon - should show as web page, not text document

## Quick Fix Steps:
1. Go to File Manager
2. Navigate to public_html (the ROOT folder)
3. Delete the current index.html
4. Create NEW FILE called exactly: `index.html`
5. Paste the content again
6. Save and close
