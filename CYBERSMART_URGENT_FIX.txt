Subject: URGENT - Disable Node.js completely

Hi Cybersmart,

The issue is that your server is still trying to run Node.js even after creating index.html.

PLEASE DO THIS:
1. In cPanel, go to "Node.js App" section
2. DISABLE or DELETE the Node.js application completely
3. Make sure index.html is in the public_html folder
4. The website should now serve the HTML file directly

OR

If you can't disable Node.js:
1. Create .htaccess file in public_html with this content:

DirectoryIndex index.html
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.html [L]

This will force the server to serve index.html instead of trying to run Node.js.

The "something went wrong" error means Node.js is still running and crashing. We need to bypass Node.js completely and serve the static HTML file.

Please try disabling Node.js first, then the .htaccess approach if needed.
