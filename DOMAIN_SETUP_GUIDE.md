# üåê Domain Setup Guide - Business Daily Deals

## Your Production URL
**Current Live Site**: https://deal-stream-simons27.replit.app

## How to Point www.businessdailydeals.co.za to Your Site

### DNS Configuration Required

You need to configure DNS records with your domain registrar or hosting provider to point your custom domain to the Replit-generated URL.

### Step 1: Access Your Domain Settings
1. Log into your domain registrar (where you bought businessdailydeals.co.za)
2. Find the DNS settings or DNS management section

### Step 2: Add CNAME Record
Create a CNAME record with these settings:

**For www subdomain:**
```
Type: CNAME
Host/Name: www
Target/Points to: deal-stream-simons27.replit.app
TTL: 3600 (or default)
```

**For root domain (optional):**
```
Type: A Record or CNAME
Host/Name: @ (or blank)
Target/Points to: deal-stream-simons27.replit.app
TTL: 3600 (or default)
```

### Step 3: Common DNS Providers

#### Cybersmart (If they're your DNS provider)
1. Log into Cybersmart control panel
2. Go to Domain Management ‚Üí DNS Settings
3. Add the CNAME record as described above

#### CloudFlare
1. Go to CloudFlare dashboard
2. Select your domain: businessdailydeals.co.za
3. Go to DNS tab
4. Click "Add record"
5. Add the CNAME record

#### GoDaddy
1. Log into GoDaddy account
2. Go to Domain Portfolio
3. Click DNS next to your domain
4. Add the CNAME record

### Step 4: SSL Certificate (Automatic)
Replit automatically provides SSL certificates, so your site will be secure with https:// once DNS propagates.

### Step 5: Wait for Propagation
- **Time**: 15 minutes to 48 hours
- **Check**: Visit www.businessdailydeals.co.za in a browser
- **Tool**: Use online DNS checker tools to verify

### Step 6: Test Your Custom Domain
Once DNS propagates, these URLs should work:
- ‚úÖ https://www.businessdailydeals.co.za
- ‚úÖ https://businessdailydeals.co.za (if you set up root domain)
