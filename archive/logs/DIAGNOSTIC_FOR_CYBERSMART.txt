CYBERSMART DIAGNOSTIC HELP

To help identify the issue with app.js:

1. Open the app.js file in: /home/simonsta/public_html/businessdailydeals-fixed/

2. Scroll to the very bottom of the file

3. Look for this line near the end:
   app.get('*', (req, res) => {

4. WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE:
   - If you see a long HTML section with "Business Daily Deals - South Africa's Premier B2B Marketplace" = CORRECT
   - If you see simple "Coming Soon" text = WRONG, needs replacement

5. QUICK FIX:
   - If it's wrong, replace the entire app.js file with the complete code Simon sent
   - Make sure the file ends with: module.exports = app;
   - Restart Node.js app

6. TEST:
   - After restart, visit www.businessdailydeals.co.za
   - Should show orange marketplace theme, not "Coming Soon"

This will fix the website immediately.
