# Finding Your Production URL - Business Daily Deals

## Deployment is Complete - Find Your Live URL

Your marketplace deployment finished successfully, but you need to find the actual production URL that Replit created.

## Where to Look for Your Production URL

### 1. Deployments Section
- Click on "Deployments" in your workspace
- Look for a section showing your active deployment
- Should display a URL like: `your-app-name.replit.app`

### 2. Common URL Formats
Your production URL will be something like:
- `business-daily-deals.replit.app`
- `dealstream.replit.app` 
- `your-repl-name.replit.app`

### 3. Look for These Elements
- "Live" or "Active" deployment status
- A clickable URL or link
- "Visit" or "Open" button next to your deployment

## What to Do Once You Find the URL

### Test Your Live Marketplace:
1. **Homepage** - Should show your casino-themed design with business stats
2. **Deal Listings** - Should display your 5 existing deals with images
3. **Navigation** - All menu items should work
4. **Registration** - Supplier and buyer registration should function

## Current Status
Your development version is running perfectly:
- All APIs responding correctly (200/304 status)
- Database connections healthy
- Images streaming successfully
- Business analytics working

**The production version should have identical functionality.**

## Next Steps After Finding URL
1. Test the live marketplace functionality
2. Configure DNS to point www.businessdailydeals.co.za to this URL
3. Set up external services (SendGrid, PayFast)
