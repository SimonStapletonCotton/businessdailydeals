# CYBERSMART TECHNICAL SUPPORT REQUEST

**Reply to Priya - Hosting Support**

Hi Priya,

Thank you for confirming the file locations. However, the issue is not about finding the files - they are already correctly placed in public_html/businessdailydeals/.

**THE ACTUAL PROBLEM:**

**Error ID: b1c8a852**  
**Error Message:** "Web application could not be started by the Phusion Passenger(R) application server"

**TECHNICAL ISSUE:** Passenger cannot start the Node.js application despite files being in correct location.

**WHAT WE NEED:**

1. **Check Passenger error logs** for Error ID b1c8a852
2. **Configure Passenger settings** for Node.js application:
   - Application root: /public_html/businessdailydeals/
   - Startup file: server/index.js
   - Node.js version: 18.20.8

3. **Verify Passenger/Node.js integration** is properly configured

**FILES ARE CORRECT - SERVER CONFIGURATION IS THE ISSUE**

The website shows "We're sorry but something went wrong" with Passenger error b1c8a852. This requires server-side Passenger configuration, not file management.

Please escalate to technical team who can:
- Review Passenger logs
- Configure application server settings
- Fix Node.js integration

**URGENT:** This is preventing website launch at www.businessdailydeals.co.za

Please provide technical support for Passenger configuration, not file location guidance.

Best regards,
Business Daily Deals Team
