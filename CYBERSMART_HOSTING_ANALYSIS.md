❌ **Nginx** - Not available for custom configuration

## Impact on Business Daily Deals

### Critical Issues
1. **Database Problem**: Our application is built with PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM - this is a fundamental architecture component
2. **Process Management**: PM2 is typically used for Node.js production deployment and process management
3. **Shared Hosting Limitations**: Our application requires dedicated server capabilities

### Recommended Solutions

#### Option 1: Alternative South African Hosting Providers
- **Hetzner South Africa** - Dedicated servers, full PostgreSQL support
- **Internet Solutions (IS)** - Enterprise hosting with database support
- **Afrihost** - VPS hosting with full control
- **SiteGround** - Premium hosting with PostgreSQL support

#### Option 2: Cloud Hosting Solutions
- **AWS Cape Town Region** - Full control, PostgreSQL RDS
- **Google Cloud Johannesburg** - Complete infrastructure
- **Azure South Africa** - Enterprise-grade hosting
- **DigitalOcean** - Simple VPS with database support

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- **Frontend on Cybersmart**: Deploy static React build
- **Backend on Cloud**: Host API and database on cloud provider
- **CDN Integration**: Use for image delivery

#### Option 4: Application Modification for Cybersmart
- **Database Migration**: Convert from PostgreSQL to MySQL (Cybersmart likely supports)
- **Process Management**: Remove PM2 dependency, use standard Node.js
- **Simplified Architecture**: Reduce to shared hosting compatible setup

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required
1. **Clarify Cybersmart Database Support**: Ask specifically about MySQL availability
2. **Alternative Hosting Research**: Evaluate South African providers with full Node.js + PostgreSQL support
3. **Architecture Decision**: Decide between modifying application or changing hosting provider

### Next Steps
1. Contact alternative South African hosting providers for quotes
2. Evaluate cost vs. feature comparison
3. Consider cloud hosting with South African data center presence
4. Plan migration strategy based on chosen solution

## Cost Considerations
- **Shared Hosting**: R50-200/month but limited functionality
- **VPS Hosting**: R300-800/month with full control
- **Cloud Hosting**: $20-50/month with global infrastructure
- **Dedicated Server**: R1000+/month with maximum performance

## Technical Requirements Not Met by Cybersmart
- PostgreSQL database server
- PM2 process management
- Full Node.js application deployment
- Custom server configuration
- WebSocket support (if needed)
- Advanced logging and monitoring

This analysis shows Cybersmart's shared hosting is insufficient for our current application architecture.
