# Cybersmart Hosting Compatibility Analysis

## Current Hosting Environment Available:
✅ Node.js: Version 18, 19, 20 (we use 18+)
✅ SSL Certificate: Already installed for businessdailydeals.co.za
✅ MySQL: Version 5.7.44 available
✅ Apache web server (instead of Nginx)
✅ Weekly automated backups with retention
✅ cPanel database management

## Missing from Shared Hosting:
❌ PostgreSQL: Not available (we currently use this)
❌ PM2: Process manager not available 
❌ Nginx: Uses Apache instead

## Required Adaptations:

### 1. Database Migration (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Convert from PostgreSQL to MySQL 5.7.44
- Update Drizzle ORM configuration for MySQL
- Modify schema definitions for MySQL compatibility
- Update connection strings and pool configuration

### 2. Process Management Alternative
- Since PM2 not available, use Node.js cluster module
- Implement graceful shutdown handling
- Add restart logic for production stability

### 3. Apache Configuration
- Create .htaccess files for routing
- Configure static file serving through Apache
- Set up proper headers and CORS

### 4. Environment Variables
- Adapt for shared hosting environment
- Use MySQL connection instead of PostgreSQL

## Recommendation:
Proceed with MySQL adaptation since:
1. All core functionality can work with MySQL
2. Shared hosting is cost-effective
3. SSL and backups already configured
4. Can always upgrade to VPS later if needed

## Alternative:
If technical complexity too high, consider their Cloud VPS option for exact requirements match.
