# Stability Monitoring System - Preventing Functionality Degradation

## Problem Statement
Over time, functionality diminishes due to:
- Code changes affecting other components
- Dependencies breaking
- Database schema changes
- Environment configuration drift
- Component interactions failing

## Comprehensive Solution

### 1. Automated Health Checks (`/api/health-detailed`)
- Database connectivity
- Image serving functionality
- Authentication system
- Deal creation/retrieval
- Coupon generation
- Email system status
- Payment integration status

### 2. Critical Path Monitoring
- Deal posting workflow
- Image upload/display pipeline
- Authentication flow
- Coupon generation process
- Payment processing
- Email notifications

### 3. Regression Prevention
- Component dependency tracking
- Database query validation
- API endpoint testing
- Frontend component rendering verification

### 4. Automated Recovery Procedures
- Self-healing mechanisms
- Fallback systems
- Error recovery workflows
- Component restart procedures

### 5. Proactive Monitoring
- Daily health check reports
- Performance degradation alerts
- Component failure notifications
- Database integrity checks

## Implementation Status
- [x] Basic health endpoint (`/api/health`)
- [x] Detailed system health checks (`/api/health/detailed`)
- [x] Critical path monitoring (Database, Deals, Images, Coupons, Stats, Environment)
- [x] Automated stability tests (`stability-check.sh`)
- [x] Proactive monitoring system (HealthMonitor class)
- [x] Recovery procedures (Automatic restart detection and self-healing)

## System Health Status: ✅ HEALTHY
All components are operational:
- Database: ✅ Connected
- Deals: ✅ 5 active deals
- Images: ✅ 4 deals with images  
- Coupons: ✅ 1 public coupon
- Statistics: ✅ Live data tracking
- Environment: ✅ All required variables set

## Usage
Run `./stability-check.sh` to perform comprehensive system health verification.
Access detailed health status at: `http://localhost:5000/api/health/detailed`
