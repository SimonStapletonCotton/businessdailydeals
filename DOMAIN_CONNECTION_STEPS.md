## To Fix Professional Domain

### Step 1: Verify DNS in Cybersmart
1. Log into cybersmart.co.za
2. Go to your domain: businessdailydeals.co.za
3. Check DNS settings show:
   - A record: `@` pointing to Replit's IP
   - A record: `www` pointing to same IP

### Step 2: Check Replit Domain Status
In your Replit Deployments → Settings → Domains:
- Look for status next to www.businessdailydeals.co.za
- Should show "Verified" when working
- May show "Pending" or error if not connected

### Step 3: DNS Propagation Time
- Can take 10 minutes to 48 hours
- Test periodically: www.businessdailydeals.co.za
- Use working URL until professional domain connects

## Business Impact
- **No functionality lost** - marketplace fully operational
- **Marketing ready** - can use working URL immediately
- **Professional domain** - will activate once DNS completes

## Next Steps
1. Use deal-stream-simons27.replit.app for immediate business needs
2. Monitor www.businessdailydeals.co.za for activation
3. Verify Cybersmart DNS settings if needed
4. Contact Cybersmart support if domain doesn't work within 48 hours

Your marketplace is ready for business - just need the professional domain to finish connecting.
