# REPLIT DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION - Agent App Constraints

## Problem Identified from Replit Documentation

**Quote from Replit Docs:**
> "Static Deployments are not compatible with Replit Apps created using Agent, as Agent typically creates full-stack applications that require a backend server."

## Why Deploy Button Has No Options

Your Business Daily Deals app was created using Replit Agent, which:
- Automatically creates full-stack applications
- Requires backend server for authentication, database, API endpoints
- Cannot use Static Deployment (frontend-only)

## Correct Deployment Solution

### Use Autoscale Deployment (Recommended)
1. Click "Deploy" button
2. Choose "Autoscale Deployment" 
3. Configuration:
   - **Start Command:** `npm start` (uses production build)
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Environment:** Production

### Why Autoscale Works for Agent Apps
- Supports full-stack applications
- Handles authentication properly
- Manages database connections
- Serves both frontend and backend
- Automatic scaling based on traffic

## Production Build Process
The `npm run build` command creates:
- Static frontend assets in `dist/public/`
- Bundled server in `dist/index.js`
- Proper production optimization

## Result
- Production URL with February 2026 content
- Proper caching and performance
- Full marketplace functionality
- Authentication and database working

This resolves the development vs production compatibility issue within Replit's Agent app constraints.
