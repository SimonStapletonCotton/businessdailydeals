# Download Instructions - Frontend Files Missing

## ERROR SOLVED: Missing public/index.html

Your server is running perfectly! It just needs the website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that visitors see.

## DOWNLOAD & UPLOAD:

### 1. Download Frontend Package:
**File:** `cpanel-public.tar.gz` or the `cpanel-public/` folder

### 2. Upload to cPanel:
1. Extract/download the `cpanel-public/` folder
2. Upload entire folder to: `/home/simonsta/public_html/businessdailydeals/`
3. **Important:** Rename `cpanel-public` to `public` after upload

### 3. Final Structure Should Look Like:
```
/home/simonsta/public_html/businessdailydeals/
├── app.js ✅ (already uploaded)
├── package.json ✅ (already uploaded)
├── .htaccess ✅ (already uploaded)
└── public/ ❌ (MISSING - needs upload)
    ├── index.html
    ├── assets/
    └── other files
```

### 4. Restart & Test:
1. Restart your Node.js app in cPanel
2. Visit: www.businessdailydeals.co.za
3. Should see the marketplace with February 20, 2026 content

**The server backend is working perfectly - just needs the frontend website files for visitors to see.**
