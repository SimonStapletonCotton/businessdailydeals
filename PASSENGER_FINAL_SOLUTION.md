# Passenger Final Solution - Business Daily Deals

## ROOT CAUSE: Passenger Not Loading Correct Application

**Issue**: Despite multiple deployments, Passenger continues serving a basic "coming soon" page instead of your complete Business Daily Deals marketplace.

## DEFINITIVE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Check Current Node.js App Configuration
In cPanel Node.js Apps, verify these exact settings:

**Required Configuration:**
- **Application root**: `public_html/businessdailydeals-fixed`
- **Application startup file**: `app.js` (NOT server/index.js)
- **Node.js version**: 18.20.8
- **Application mode**: Production

### Step 2: Create Root-Level app.js File
The issue is Passenger expects the main file in the application root, not in a subfolder.

**Create this file in your application root:**
`public_html/businessdailydeals-fixed/app.js`

### Step 3: Verify File Structure
```
public_html/businessdailydeals-fixed/
├── app.js                    ← MAIN ENTRY POINT (Passenger requirement)
├── package.json              ← Dependencies
├── server/                   ← Backend files
├── client/                   ← Frontend files
└── shared/                   ← Database schemas
```

### Step 4: Alternative Troubleshooting
If still showing "coming soon":

**A. Check Passenger Log File**
Location: `/home/simonsta/logs/businessdailydeals.log`
Look for: Module errors, database failures, startup issues

**B. Verify Dependencies**
Run NPM install in the correct directory where package.json exists

**C. Test Different Entry Points**
Try these startup files in order:
1. `app.js` (root level)
2. `index.js` (root level)  
3. `server/index.js` (current)

### Step 5: Emergency Fallback
If technical issues persist, contact Cybersmart support with:
- Passenger log file contents
- Screenshot of Node.js app configuration
- Request: "Application serves 'coming soon' instead of Node.js app"

## EXPECTED RESULT
When correctly configured, www.businessdailydeals.co.za should display:
- Orange casino-themed Business Daily Deals homepage
- 8 Hot Deals with professional business images
- Complete navigation and functionality
- "FREE UNTIL 20TH FEBRUARY 2026" promotional messaging

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR
The main application file MUST be in the root of the application directory, not in a subfolder. Passenger requires direct access to the entry point.
