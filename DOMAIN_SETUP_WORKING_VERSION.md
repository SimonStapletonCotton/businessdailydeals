# IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Point Custom Domain to Working Development Version

## The Problem
- Development version: ✅ 13 deals working with images, casino homepage, February 2026 dates
- Deployment version: ❌ Only 3 old deals, no images, outdated data

## Immediate Solution
Point your custom domain `www.businessdailydeals.co.za` to the **development version** which has all working features.

## Your Current Development URL
The working version is running on your Replit development environment. You can find the URL by:

1. **In your Replit workspace**, look at the address bar when viewing the preview
2. **Or check the "Webview" tab** for the current development URL
3. **Typically formatted like**: `https://[repl-name]-[username].replit.dev`

## DNS Setup Instructions
Once you have your development URL:

### At Your DNS Provider (Namecheap/Cybersmart)
1. **Delete existing A/CNAME records** for `www.businessdailydeals.co.za`
2. **Add new CNAME record**:
   - **Name**: `www`
   - **Value**: `[your-repl-name]-[username].replit.dev` (without https://)
   - **TTL**: 300 (5 minutes for quick updates)

### Verify Working Features
After DNS propagation (5-15 minutes), `www.businessdailydeals.co.za` will show:
- ✅ Casino homepage with one-armed bandit slot machine
- ✅ Orange-to-slate gradient background  
- ✅ 8 Hot Deals section with images
- ✅ 5 Regular Deals section with images
- ✅ February 20th, 2026 promotional dates
- ✅ Working supplier dashboard
- ✅ Full marketplace functionality

## Why This Works
- Development environment has the complete, updated database
- All APIs are working (8 hot + 5 regular deals)
- Images are loading properly
- Casino homepage design is active
- No manual file uploads needed - automatic updates

## Alternative: Fix Deployment Database
If you prefer to keep using the deployment URL, I can create a script to sync the deployment database with the current development data. This requires running a database migration on the deployment.

**Recommendation**: Use the development URL approach for immediate results.
