# Coupon Validation System - Exact Step-by-Step Process

## How It Works in Real Practice

- **Purchase Details**: Deal price, what they bought
- **Valid Until**: Expiry date (if applicable)

### Step 2: Customer Brings Coupon to Supplier
Customer visits supplier location with coupon code (printed or digital)

### Step 3: Supplier Uses Verification System

**Supplier workflow** (already familiar with platform as advertiser):
1. **Login**: Uses existing Business Daily Deals account
2. **Access**: Navigate to coupon verification page  
3. **Verify**: Enter customer's coupon code

**Process**:
1. **Enter Code**: Supplier types `BDD-ABC123`
2. **Click Validate**: System instantly checks database
3. **See Results**: Complete coupon information displayed

### Step 4: Validation Results (3 Possible Outcomes)
