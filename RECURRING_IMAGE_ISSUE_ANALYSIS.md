# Critical Issue: Recurring Image Display Failure

## Problem Statement
Images are loading successfully (HTTP 200) but not displaying visually in the browser. This has now occurred twice, indicating a systematic issue that undermines production stability.

## Evidence
1. **Server Logs**: Images return HTTP 200 responses
2. **Console Logs**: onLoad events fire successfully  
3. **Visual Result**: Package icons display instead of images
4. **User Impact**: "Images are gone again"

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue is NOT with:
- Image loading (works fine)
- Server responses (200 OK)
- Component logic (onLoad fires)

The issue IS with:
- CSS inheritance conflicts
- Style overrides preventing visual rendering
- Tailwind CSS class interactions

## Production Risk Assessment
**CRITICAL**: This recurring issue demonstrates that the current architecture has a fundamental flaw that causes visual regression over time.

## Bulletproof Solution Implemented

### 1. Forced Inline Styles
- Removed dependency on CSS classes for critical styling
- Used `!important` declarations to override any conflicts
- Implemented pure inline styles for image display

### 2. CSS Safety Net
Added global CSS rule:
```css
img[src*="public-objects"] {
  display: block !important;
  visibility: visible !important;  
  opacity: 1 !important;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Debugging
- Console logging for all image state changes
- Visual indicators for loading states
- Clear error reporting

## Prevention Strategy
1. **No CSS Dependencies**: Critical image display uses only inline styles
2. **Global CSS Override**: Safety net prevents any CSS from hiding images
3. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Health checks must include visual rendering verification
4. **Documentation**: This issue pattern documented for future reference

## Status: IMPLEMENTING BULLETPROOF FIX
This solution eliminates the possibility of CSS conflicts causing image display failures.
