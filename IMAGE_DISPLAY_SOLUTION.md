# Image Display Issue Resolution

## Problem Description
Images were loading successfully (HTTP 200 responses) and triggering onLoad events, but were not visually displaying in the browser. This created a functionality degradation where deal images appeared as blank spaces.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by conflicting CSS styles and complex style overrides in the DealImage component that prevented images from rendering visually, despite successful loading.

## Solution Implemented
### Fixed DealImage Component
- Removed complex style overrides and debugging code
- Implemented clean, minimal CSS approach
- Used inline styles with `objectFit: 'cover'` for proper image scaling
- Maintained loading states and error handling
- Ensured proper responsive behavior

### Key Changes
1. **Simplified Styling**: Removed conflicting CSS classes and complex positioning
2. **Object Fit**: Added `objectFit: 'cover'` for proper image scaling within containers
3. **Clean Implementation**: Removed debug overlays and forced visibility styles
4. **Maintained Functionality**: Kept loading states, error handling, and fallback displays

## Prevention Measures
1. **Stability Monitoring**: Enhanced health checks now monitor image display functionality
2. **Simple CSS**: Using minimal, proven CSS patterns for image display
3. **Consistent Implementation**: Standardized image component across all deal displays

## Test Results
- ✅ Images now display correctly in Hot Deals section
- ✅ Images display correctly in Regular Deals section  
- ✅ Loading states work properly
- ✅ Error fallbacks function correctly
- ✅ Responsive scaling maintained

## Status: RESOLVED
Date: August 11, 2025
Images are now displaying correctly across all deal sections with proper styling and responsive behavior.
