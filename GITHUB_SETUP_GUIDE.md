# GitHub Repository Setup for Business Daily Deals

## Current Status
✅ Git is already initialized in your project  
✅ All code and database schema are ready to sync  
✅ Project is fully functional with 13 deals and casino homepage

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click "New" or "+"** → "New repository"
3. **Repository name**: `businessdailydeals`
4. **Description**: "Business Daily Deals B2B Marketplace - South African B2B platform with casino-themed design"
5. **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Your Replit to GitHub

### Option A: Using Replit's Git Panel (Recommended)
1. **In Replit**, look for the **Git tab** in the left sidebar
2. **Click "Connect to GitHub"** or similar option
3. **Authorize Replit** to access your GitHub account
4. **Select your "businessdailydeals" repository**

### Option B: Using Shell Commands
If the Git panel doesn't work, use these commands in the Shell:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/businessdailydeals.git

# Stage all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Business Daily Deals B2B Marketplace

- Casino-themed homepage with slot machine animation
- 13 deals (8 hot + 5 regular) with images
- PostgreSQL + MySQL dual database support
- Supplier dashboard and credit system
- February 20th, 2026 promotional period
- Production-ready codebase"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: What Gets Uploaded

Your GitHub repository will include:
- ✅ **Complete codebase** (React frontend + Express backend)
- ✅ **Database schema** (Drizzle ORM models)
- ✅ **Documentation** (all .md files with deployment guides)
- ✅ **Configuration files** (package.json, tsconfig, etc.)
- ✅ **Environment templates** (.env.cybersmart, etc.)

## Step 4: Repository Structure
```

## Benefits of GitHub Integration
