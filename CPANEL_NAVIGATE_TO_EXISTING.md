# cPanel: How to Find Your Existing Node.js App

## The Problem:
You're in the "Create New Application" form, but you need to edit the existing app.

## Solution: Navigate to Your Existing App

### Option 1: Look for Navigation Tabs
At the top of the Node.js Selector page, look for tabs like:
- **"Applications"** or **"Manage Applications"**
- **"Create Application"** (you're probably here now)

Click on **"Applications"** or **"Manage Applications"** to see your existing apps.

### Option 2: Scroll Down on Current Page
Sometimes existing applications are listed below the create form. Scroll down to look for:
- A table showing your current applications
- Your app listed as: `businessdailydeals-fixed`

### Option 3: Check Your App Status
Look for a section that might say:
- "Current Applications"
- "Running Applications" 
- "Application List"

### What You Should See:
When you find the existing app, you'll see:
- **Path**: `/home/simonsta/public_html/businessdailydeals-fixed/`
- **Status**: Running/Stopped
- **Actions**: Edit | Restart | Stop | Delete

Click **"Edit"** on that existing app (not create new).

### If You Still Can't Find It:
Try this URL directly (replace your session ID):
`https://cpanel26.mywebserver.co.za:2083/cpsess[YOUR_SESSION]/frontend/jupiter/lveversion/nodejs-selector.html.tt#/applications`

## Key Point:
The application root `/home/simonsta/public_html/businessdailydeals-fixed/` is CORRECT.
You just need to edit the existing app, not create a new one.
